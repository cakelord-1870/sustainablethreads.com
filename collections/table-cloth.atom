<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Tea time, supper time or party time? Your table will be forever transformed with this unique hand block printed tablecloth, exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads. This style comes edged with hand-knotted tassels.</p>
<p>Hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. Several dozen, if not hundreds, of impressions are required to complete a single finished product. Enjoy this creation, made with a whole lot of patience and love!</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. Fringe tassels are knotted by hand. <br>This artisan group based in Western India, focuses on women from low-income households, slum communities and offers skill-building and employment opportunities.</p></td>

<h5>Description </h5>
<p>Tea time, supper time or party time? Your table will be forever transformed with this unique hand block printed tablecloth, exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads.  </p>
<p>Hand printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. Several dozen, if not hundreds, of impressions are required to complete a single finished product. Enjoy this creation, made with a whole lot of patience and love!  </p>
<p><span mce-data-marked="1">Co-ordinated </span><span>runner is</span><span> available to purchase separately.</span></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>Description </h5>
<p>This is a pure cotton tablecloth, woven by hand on manual looms and enhanced with a complex weave to create a raised texture, which conveys the beauty of handloom weaves and cannot be reproduced on machines. </p>

<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>This textile is produced on hand-operated looms, one of the oldest methods of textile production. Handweaving involves interlinking a set of vertical threads (warp) with a set of horizontal threads (weft,) meticulous planning and complex estimation, depending on the design. In this product, two different yarn colors are used - one in the weft and the other in the warp.  <br>Handwoven at a small weaving unit in Northern India by adult members of a community of physically challenged artisans and their families. The work offers them employment, life skills training and an avenue for social acceptance.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Tea time, supper time or party time? Your table will be forever transformed with this unique hand block printed tablecloth, exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads. This style comes edged with hand-knotted tassels.</p>
<p>Hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. Several dozen, if not hundreds, of impressions are required to complete a single finished product. Enjoy this creation, made with a whole lot of patience and love!</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. Fringe tassels are knotted by hand. <br>This artisan group based in Western India, focuses on women from low-income households, slum communities and offers skill-building and employment opportunities.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Tea time, supper time or party time? Your table will be forever transformed with this unique hand block printed tablecloth, exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads.</p>
<p>Hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. Several dozen, if not hundreds, of impressions are required to complete a single finished product. Enjoy this creation, made with a whole lot of patience and love! </p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing.

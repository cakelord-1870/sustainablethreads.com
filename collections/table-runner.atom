Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color.

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Crafted using natural fiber from the flax plant that is strong, durable and breathable. Highly absorbent, flax linen gets softer and more luxurious with use. Our linen runner is designed to create an interplay of colors. Three yarn colors are hand-dyed and then strung in a combination on the warp and weft. Hand weaving different thread colors into patterns is a much more laborious process than weaving with a single color, but is a valuable component, given the beauty of the final product. <br><br>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Hand weaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.<br><br>Matching napkins are available to purchase separately.<br><br>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Rural weavers from Northern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated looms. The artisans carefully string yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp. They then weave horizontal interlacing threads (weft), creating expressive, decorative patterns. Two colors in the warp and a different color in the weft are strung. Determination of how closely the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Crafted using natural fiber from the flax plant that is strong, durable and breathable. Highly absorbent, flax linen gets softer and more luxurious with use. Our linen runner is designed to create an interplay of colors. Three yarn colors are hand-dyed and then strung in a combination on the warp and weft. Hand weaving different thread colors into patterns is a much more laborious process than weaving with a single color, but is a valuable component, given the beauty of the final product. <br><br>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Hand weaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.<br><br>Matching napkins are available to purchase separately.<br><br>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Rural weavers from Northern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated looms. The artisans carefully string yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp. They then weave horizontal interlacing threads (weft), creating expressive, decorative patterns. Two colors in the warp and a different color in the weft are strung. Determination of how closely the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.</p></td>

<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>This product is created from renewable resources, primarily from the fibrous part of banana stems. After harvesting the fruit, the stem (trunk) is cut as close to the ground as possible. Earlier treated as agricultural waste, the banana plant is now being used to fashion beautiful, contemporary, biodegradable handcrafted home goods and more.  Additionally, other natural fibers such as river grass, jute, coconut leaf splinters and bamboo are combined with the banana fiber.</p>
<p>Woven on traditional handlooms, hand-twisted banana fiber strips and one or more other natural raw fiber is aligned to be used in the weft, while cotton yarn in different colors is used in the warp. Prior to weaving, banana fiber ropes are constructed by twisting banana stem strips, using a hand-operated wheel. Yarn-dyeing and setting the loom are labor and time-consuming processes, but this ensures our exclusive designs, patterns and textures are achieved.</p></td>

<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br><br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.<br></p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p><br data-mce-fragment="1">Beautify and protect your dining table with exceptional hand block printed runners! Or decorate a coffee table, kitchen island or console. Hand-carved wooden blocks are dipped in low-impact dyes and stamped on unbleached, unprocessed cotton. This piece is edged with pretty, hand-knotted tassels. </p>
<p>Kind and caring to the environment, hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto fabric. Numerous careful impressions are required to complete a single finished product.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. Fringe tassels are knotted by hand. <br>This artisan group based in Western India, focuses on women from low-income households, slum communities and offers skill-building and employment opportunities. </p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This special silk is created from a blend of cruelty-free (Eri) and mulberry silk. Eri silk is considered compassionate as silk worms aren't killed for their cocoon, unlike in conventional silk-making. Mulberry silkworms on the other hand are domesticated and usually reared indoors. Silk threads are handspun, then handwoven into this gorgeous piece!</p>

<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Traditional techniques are used to create this modern and stylish collection. Artisans spin yarn by hand, dye with low-impact dyes and handweave. Each of these steps support artisan livelihood. Silk fabric is woven on hand-operated looms. Artisans carefully string threads vertically upon the loom. They then weave horizontal interlacing threads in decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Created in an eco-friendly environment, the only components of the process that use fossil fuels are heating of the dye-bath with gas and a nominal amount of electricity for the calendaring process. Waste water is treated before being released into drains.</p></td>

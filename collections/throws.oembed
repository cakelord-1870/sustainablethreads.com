The cocoon is harvested after the silkworms turn into moths and vacate them. The rupture causes the long, continuous silk strands to be broken into several shorter strands. These are handspun on a spinning wheel and may have little nubs where two strands join. This process is highly valued, and offers a greater degree of fiber purity, emphasizing the natural luster of the silk. In contrast, in conventional silks, the silkworms within the cocoons are killed as part of the process.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silk is woven on \u003cem\u003ezidagar \u003c\/em\u003eframe looms which are crafted from bamboo and other locally available materials.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Women Weaver's Trust (Cruelty-free Silk)","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":12850346721335,"sku":"700-90-TH","price":135.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2010\/2557\/products\/700-90-TH-2.jpg?v=1605061804"}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2010\/2557\/collections\/Artisan_-_weaving_2.jpg?v=1620414746","url":"https:\/\/sustainablethreads.com\/collections\/throws.oembed","provider":"SustainableThreads","version":"1.0","type":"link"}

<p>Protect your dinner table from food stains and hot dinnerware or transform a drab table with one-of-a-kind block printed tablemats. These conversation pieces are exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads.</p>
<p>Hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric.

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<span>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, </span><em>kora</em><span> cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. </span><br><span>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</span><br></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Traditional weavers create our choice handwoven placemats from a blend of banana plant stem and cotton.<br> <br> Banana plants bear fruit only once in their lifetime and head for landfills once the fruit is harvested. Banana plant agricultural waste is re-purposed and transformed into strong, durable, and renewable ropes, to create these exquisite placemats. Spoil yourself or gift a loved one!!<br> <br> A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India. <br></p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>This product is created from renewable resources, primarily from the fibrous part of banana stems. After harvesting the fruit, the stem (trunk) is cut as close to the ground as possible. Earlier treated as agricultural waste, the banana plant is now being used to fashion beautiful, contemporary, biodegradable handcrafted home goods and more.  Additionally, other natural fibers such as river grass, jute, coconut leaf splinters and bamboo are combined with the banana fiber.<br> <br> Woven on traditional handlooms, hand-twisted banana fiber strips and one or more other natural raw fiber is aligned to be used in the weft, while cotton yarn in different colors is used in the warp. Prior to weaving, banana fiber ropes are constructed by twisting banana stem strips, using a hand-operated wheel. Yarn-dyeing and setting the loom are labor and time-consuming processes, but this ensures our exclusive designs, patterns and textures are achieved. </p></td>

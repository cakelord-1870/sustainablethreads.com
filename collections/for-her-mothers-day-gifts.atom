<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Make entertaining guests an indulgence with Sustainable Threads' stunning hand block printed cotton napkins! Heavy weight kora (unbleached &amp; unprocessed) cotton. Highly absorbent, they are a great alternative to disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, they make an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.  </p>

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>Hand-stamped by physically challenged artisans who are given a choice of various crafts to be trained in, including block printing, to help best utilize their abilities and interests, </p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>The solid color napkins involve merging of 2 different thread shades from the warp and the weft, the interplay of which creates a soft sheen. Soft and highly absorbent, these are a practical way to reduce consumption of disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, it makes an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.</p>
<p>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created, requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Handweaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Indigenous women weavers from Eastern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated frame looms. These looms are made using bamboo and other locally available materials. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp and horizontally to create the weft. They then weave the interlacing threads, creating expressive, decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Indigenous women weavers from Eastern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated frame looms. These looms are made using bamboo and other locally available materials. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp and horizontally to create the weft. They then weave the interlacing threads, creating expressive, decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Make entertaining guests an indulgence with Sustainable Threads' stunning hand block printed cotton napkins! Heavy weight kora (unbleached &amp; unprocessed) cotton. Highly absorbent, they are a great alternative to disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, they make an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.  </p>
<p>Kind and caring to the environment, hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped on to fabric. Numerous careful impressions are required to complete a single finished product.  </p>
<p><span mce-data-marked="1">Co-ordinated </span><span>tablecloth is</span><span> available to purchase separately.</span></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p> Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>Hand-stamped by physically challenged artisans who are given a choice of various crafts to be trained in, including block printing, to help best utilize their abilities and interests, </p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Our two-toned handwoven napkins involve merging of 3 different thread colors, two from the warp and one from the weft. Interlaced together, it produces an illusion of a soft metallic sheen. Soft and highly absorbent, these are a practical way to reduce consumption of disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, it makes an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.</p>
<p>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created, requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Handweaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Indigenous women weavers from Eastern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated frame looms. These looms are made using bamboo and other locally available materials. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp and horizontally to create the weft. They then weave the interlacing threads, creating expressive, decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

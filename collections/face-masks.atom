<h5>Description</h5>
<p><span>Our hand block printed double-layered face masks are made from 100% cotton. Added pleats allow flexibility of size and can be expanded to your liking. Low-impact dyes, means you will not be breathing any harsh chemicals. Since the masks are reversible, there are no wrong sides and you can wear either of the 2 trendy prints.<br></span></p>

<p>Kind and caring to the environment, hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped on to fabric. Numerous careful impressions are required to complete a single finished product.  </p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created, requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Handweaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Indigenous women weavers from Eastern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated frame looms. These looms are made using bamboo and other locally available materials. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp and horizontally to create the weft. They then weave the interlacing threads, creating expressive, decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Our handwoven double-layered face masks are made from organically-farmed cotton. Soft, light and breathable, these face masks can be comfortably worn for long periods and neutral colors allow you to match it with any outfit. Added pleats allow flexibility of size and can be expanded to your liking. All-natural dyes are used to dye threads, which means you will not be breathing in any harsh chemicals and the Candle Blow test offers added protection. Since the masks are reversible, there are no wrong sides. <br></p>
<p>We recommend washing the garment before use. Due to sanitary reasons, we are not accepting returns.<br></p>
<p>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Handweaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.<br></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Rural weavers from Western India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated looms. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp and horizontally to create the weft. They then weave the interlacing threads, creating expressive, decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

<p>Kind and caring to the environment, hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped on to fabric. Numerous careful impressions are required to complete a single finished product.  </p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Wrap yourself in the warmth and luxury of this beautiful, cruelty-free silk throw. Handwoven by skilled indigenous artisans, this unique, luxurious silk is considered cruelty-free and compassionate as silk worms aren't harmed, unlike in conventional silk-making, in which cocoon extraction involves killing silk worms in boiling water. Empty cocoons are obtained after a patient wait for silk worms to metamorphose into moths. No pesticide, chemicals, or modern machines are used in any of the production processes. A minimalist design complements its luxurious texture &amp; fine elegance.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>This special silk known as cruelty-free silk (also known as <em>Ahimsa </em>or non-violent silk) is the most humane of all silk production practices. The cocoon is harvested after the silkworms turn into moths and vacate them. The rupture causes the long, continuous silk strands to be broken into several shorter strands. These are handspun on a spinning wheel and may have little nubs where two strands join. This process is highly valued, and offers a greater degree of fiber purity, emphasizing the natural luster of the silk. In contrast, in conventional silks, the silkworms within the cocoons are killed as part of the process.</p>
<p>The silk is woven on <em>zidagar </em>frame looms which are crafted from bamboo and other locally available materials.</p></td>

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>This special silk known as cruelty-free silk (also known as <em>Ahimsa </em>or non-violent silk) is the most humane of all silk production practices. The cocoon is harvested after the silkworms turn into moths and vacate them. The rupture causes the long, continuous silk strands to be broken into several shorter strands. These are handspun on a spinning wheel and may have little nubs where two strands join. This process is highly valued, and offers a greater degree of fiber purity, emphasizing the natural luster of the silk. In contrast, in conventional silks, the silkworms within the cocoons are killed as part of the process.</p>
<p>The silk is woven on <em>zidagar </em>frame looms which are crafted from bamboo and other locally available materials.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Wrap yourself in the warmth and luxury of this beautiful cruelty-free silk throw. This unique, luxurious silk is considered cruelty-free and compassionate as silk worms aren't harmed, unlike in conventional silk-making, in which cocoon extraction involves killing silk worms in boiling water. Empty cocoons are obtained after a patient wait for silk worms to metamorphose into moths. Silk threads are handspun then handwoven to create this exclusive piece!  </p>
<p>Cocoon cultivators, spinners, dyers, weavers and tailors are all part of the community of rural artisans who benefit from this effort. </p>

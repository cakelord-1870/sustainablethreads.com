<p>Artisans first blend scrap fabric with water until the mixture becomes a watery paste. To create the broad spectrum of colors, vibrant azo-free dyes are added at this stage.

Excess water is first removed using a hydraulic press, then individual sheets are hung to dry. Once fully dry, each sheet is pressed flat. Many are then embellished with beautiful hand block print designs.</p></td>

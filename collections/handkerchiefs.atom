<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Indigenous women weavers from Eastern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated frame looms. These looms are made using bamboo and other locally available materials. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp. They then weave horizontal interlacing threads (weft), creating expressive, decorative patterns. <br><br>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

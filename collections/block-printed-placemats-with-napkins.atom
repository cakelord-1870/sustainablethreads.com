<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Make entertaining guests an indulgence with Sustainable Threads' stunning hand block printed, heavyweight cotton napkins! Highly absorbent, they are a great alternative to disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, they make an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.  </p>
<p>4 gorgeous black and white complementary print designs are compiled to form this stylish set!</p>
<p>Kind and caring to the environment, hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped on to fabric. Numerous careful impressions are required to complete a single finished product.  <br></p>
<p><span>Co-ordinated</span><span> </span><span>placemats and runners </span><span>are available to purchase separately.</span><br></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Make entertaining guests an indulgence with Sustainable Threads' stunning hand block printed, heavyweight cotton napkins! Highly absorbent, they are a great alternative to disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, they make an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.  </p>
<p>Kind and caring to the environment, hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped on to fabric. Numerous careful impressions are required to complete a single finished product.  </p>
<p><span>Co-ordinated</span><span> </span><span>placemats</span><span> </span><span>are available to purchase separately.</span></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Make entertaining guests an indulgence with Sustainable Threads' stunning hand block printed cotton napkins! Heavy weight kora (unbleached &amp; unprocessed) cotton. Highly absorbent, they are a great alternative to disposable paper napkins. Packaged with a belly band and a hanger, they make an excellent party favor and host or hostess gift.  </p>

<p><span>Matching tablecloth is</span><span> available to purchase separately.</span></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>Hand-stamped by physically challenged artisans who are given a choice of various crafts to be trained in, including block printing, to help best utilize their abilities and interests, </p></td>

Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing.

<h5>Description</h5>
<p><span>This beautiful, hand-screen printed</span><span> </span><span><span class="il">sarong</span></span><span> </span><span>is made of 100% cotton and will keep you comfortable and looking cool. A must-have for a pool party or your beach vacay! Use as a wrap around skirt, a wrap around dress, a shawl or scarf.</span></p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. <span data-mce-fragment="1">Handmade by artisans in India. </span></p>
<h5>How It's Made<br>
</h5>
<p>Artisans use low-impact dyes to screen-print. The fabric is first set up on a frame and a stencil of the design is positioned on the fabric to spread dye or ink. The process has to be repeated for different colors and the dye has to be allowed to dry completely before using a dye of a different color. Artisans have to be knowledgeable of the dyes and the fabric and how they work with each other.</p></td>

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Tea time, supper time or party time? Your table will be forever transformed with this unique hand block printed tablecloth, exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads. This style comes edged with hand-knotted tassels.</p>
<p>Hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. Several dozen, if not hundreds, of impressions are required to complete a single finished product. Enjoy this creation, made with a whole lot of patience and love!</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. Fringe tassels are knotted by hand. <br>This artisan group based in Western India, focuses on women from low-income households, slum communities and offers skill-building and employment opportunities.</p></td>

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, <em>kora </em>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. <br>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</p></td>

<p>This artisan group uses a broad spectrum of skills. Weavers use both pit and frame looms to create yards of lush fabrics.

<p>The trust distributes raw materials like yarn, dyes and fabric directly to groups in the trust. The local group then divides work among artisans and collaborates to complete orders.

<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>This textile is produced on hand-operated looms, one of the oldest methods of textile production. Handweaving involves interlinking a set of vertical threads (warp) with a set of horizontal threads (weft,) meticulous planning and complex estimation, depending on the design. In this product, two different yarn colors are used - one in the weft and the other in the warp. <br>Handwoven at a small weaving unit in Northern India by adult members of a community of physically challenged artisans, and their families. The work offers them employment, life skills training and an avenue for social acceptance.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Protect your dinner table from food stains and hot dinnerware or transform a drab table with one-of-a-kind block printed tablemats. These conversation pieces are exclusively designed by and for Sustainable Threads.</p>
<p>Hand block printing is a labor-intensive process that involves carving designs on individual wooden blocks, to which dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. Several dozen impressions are required to complete a single finished product. Enjoy this creation, made with a whole lot of patience and love!</p>

<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p><span>Artisans apply block print patterns to natural, </span><em>kora </em><span>cotton - this is unbleached fabric, and is the purest form of cotton. To start printing, an artisan evenly applies dye to a hand-carved wooden block. The fabric is then hand-stamped firmly and steadily, leaving a printed pattern. Dye is frequently added to maintain the same intensity of color. Once the printing is finished with a specific color and block, the artisan cleans the block and must wait for the cloth to dry before continuing. This is a deceptively simple art - each piece features dozens, if not hundreds, of careful impressions. </span><br><span>The artisan community suffered forced displacement in the late eighties, losing their ancestral homes and farmlands in the process. This work offers a sustainable source of fair income and an off-farm livelihood.</span></p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p><span>Our gorgeous yarn-dyed, handwoven napkins are made from organically-farmed cotton.

<p>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Handweaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>Rural weavers from Western India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated looms. The artisans carefully string cotton yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp and horizontally to create the weft. They then weave the interlacing threads, creating expressive, decorative patterns.</p>
<p>Depending on the design, either a single color in the warp and a different color in the weft; a single color in the warp and multiple colors in the weft; or multiple colors both in the warp and weft are strung. Determination of how close the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.  </p></td>

<p>Our handwoven flax linen napkins are designed to create an interplay of colors. Each napkin comes in a combination of three yarn colors that are hand-dyed and then strung in a combination on the warp and weft. Handweaving different thread colors into patterns is a much more laborious process than weaving with a single color, but is a valuable component, given the beauty of the final product.

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Crafted using natural fiber from the flax plant that is strong, durable and breathable. Highly absorbent, flax linen gets softer and more luxurious with use. Our linen runner is designed to create an interplay of colors. Three yarn colors are hand-dyed and then strung in a combination on the warp and weft. Hand weaving different thread colors into patterns is a much more laborious process than weaving with a single color, but is a valuable component, given the beauty of the final product. <br><br>Handwoven fabrics are meticulously planned and created requiring a complex estimation, depending on the design. Hand weaving is unforgiving: mistakes cannot be reversed as weaves can't be undone.<br><br>Matching napkins are available to purchase separately.<br><br>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.</p>
<h5>How It's Made </h5>
<p>Rural weavers from Northern India have skillfully crafted this product on hand-operated looms. The artisans carefully string yarn vertically upon the loom to create the warp. They then weave horizontal interlacing threads (weft), creating expressive, decorative patterns. Two colors in the warp and a different color in the weft are strung. Determination of how closely the warp yarns will be placed next to each other, precise calculation of where the next color thread will be incorporated (e.g. 1-inch stripes,) and careful calculation for minimal loom waste are some other steps of the process. Handweaving is unforgiving as once woven, weaves can't be undone.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Wrap yourself in the warmth and luxury of this beautiful cruelty-free silk throw. This unique, luxurious silk is considered cruelty-free and compassionate as silk worms aren't harmed, unlike in conventional silk-making, in which cocoon extraction involves killing silk worms in boiling water. Empty cocoons are obtained after a patient wait for silk worms to metamorphose into moths. Silk threads are handspun then handwoven to create this exclusive piece!  </p>
<p>Cocoon cultivators, spinners, dyers, weavers and tailors are all part of the community of rural artisans who benefit from this effort. </p>
<p> A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India.  </p>
<h5>How It's Made  </h5>
<p>This special silk known as cruelty-free silk (also known as <em>Ahimsa </em>or non-violent silk) is the most humane of all silk production practices. The cocoon is harvested after the silkworms turn into moths and vacate them. The rupture causes the long, continuous silk strands to be broken into several shorter strands. These are handspun on a spinning wheel and may have little nubs where two strands join. This process is highly valued, and offers a greater degree of fiber purity, emphasizing the natural luster of the silk. In contrast, in conventional silks, the silkworms within the cocoons are killed as part of the process. </p>
<p>Artisans handspin yarn, dye with low-impact, Azo-free dyes, and handweave the products on wooden pit looms. Each of these steps support local artisan livelihood.</p></td>

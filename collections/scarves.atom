<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Artisans expertly convey their creativity through vibrant patterns and imaginative designs. They are members of an artisan trust and use a broad spectrum of skills to create a beautiful product range. Each artisan becomes a shareholder when they join the trust and are eligible to serve on the board. This means that in addition to a fair wage, artisans also receive a share of profits and can have a say in decision-making.</p>
<p>A Fair Trade product. Handmade by artisans in India. <br></p>
<h5>How It's Made</h5>
<p>This artisan group uses a broad spectrum of skills. Weavers use both pit and frame looms to create yards of lush fabrics. Dyers expertly apply dyes ranging from warm earthy hues to vivid jewel tones, and include techniques such as tie-dye or batik treatments. Artisans expertly convey their creativity through vibrant patterns and imaginative designs using intricate and striking embroidery techniques! The embroidery techniques used are Soof, Ari and Sindi.  The motifs are inspired by nature and are geographic in form.<br></p>
<p>The trust distributes raw materials like yarn, dyes and fabric directly to groups in the trust. The local group then divides work among artisans and collaborates to complete orders. They receive skill training and their products undergo quality control checks,  both of which allow for the groups to expect larger and more predictable work, ensuring sustainable growth.</p></td>

<p>Skilled artisans create these stunning<span> </span><em>khadi<span> </span></em>cotton scarves.<span> </span><em>Khadi</em>, handspun and handwoven fabric, is not only environmentally sustainable; it symbolizes empowerment and freedom for many in India.

<p>There is much diversity in the specifics of creating<span> </span><em>khadi</em><span> </span>in central India, but the basic process is similar. First, seeds and other debris are removed from the cotton crop. Fibers are cleaned, sorted and arranged. Next, spinners use a form of the<span> </span><em>charkha</em>, hand-operated spinning wheel, to manipulate fiber into uniform-width yarn. The yarn is wound on to bobbins and some are strung on handlooms. Weavers then use a shuttle to weave yarn. The trust celebrates the rich weaving heritage in this region by highlighting the diverse methods, aesthetics, and tools.</p></td>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Experience pure and natural pleasure in this stunning cotton scarf, handspun and handwoven on manual looms. Certified organic yarn is dyed with natural, plant-based dyes. The women spinners and weavers who create this scarf are part of a non-profit enterprise, located in Central India, that seeks to improve the economic and social circumstances of rural weavers in the region.</p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1">A Fair Trade product. </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">Handmade by artisans in India. <br></span><br></p>
<h5>How it's Made</h5>
<p>Skilled artisans create these stunning<span> </span><em>khadi<span> </span></em>cotton scarves.<span> </span><em>Khadi</em>, handspun and handwoven fabric, is not only environmentally sustainable; it symbolizes empowerment and freedom for many in India. During the independence movement, Gandhi famously advocated for the revival of<span> </span><em>khadi</em><span> </span>fabric both as a form of non-violent resistance to imperialism and as a symbolic foundation upon which to build a new India. </p>
<p>There is much diversity in the specifics of creating<span> </span><em>khadi</em><span> </span>in Central India, but the basic process is similar. First, seeds and other debris are removed from the cotton crop. Fibers are cleaned, sorted and arranged. Next, spinners use a form of the<span> </span><em>charkha</em>, hand-operated spinning wheel, to manipulate fiber into uniform-width yarn. The yarn is wound on to bobbins and some are strung on handlooms. Weavers then use a shuttle to weave yarn.</p>
<p>The trust celebrates the rich weaving heritage in this region by highlighting the diverse methods, aesthetics, and tools.</p></td>
